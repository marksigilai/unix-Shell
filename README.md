SEEsh is a UNIX shell that makes facilities of the operating system available to the users. 

It reads lines from the user and then performs lexical analysis on the line to form tokens. Once the tokens are created, they are fed to the command interpreter which executes the command. 

It supports the following commands: cd, pwd, help, exit, set var [value], unset var.
